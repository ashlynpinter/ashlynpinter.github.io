             <p> The world is made up of tiny things</br>
              like the stars and how my heart jumps when the phone rings<br>
            like the way the light comes through the window pane or the way you speak so softly when you say my name</br>
            like the silent wings of a bird when it flys</br>
       or the way i lose myself in you bright brown eyes </br>
    like a meteor shower in the sky or the way you drag your hand across my thigh</br>
its the little things like this that make me whole,</br>
its the shooting stars and the roughness of your hands that make up my soul</br>
-A.P.</br>
             </p>
             <p>2.</p>
<p>Memories are matters of the heart not the mind,</br>
Heart beating rampant but my mind lags behind.</br>
I dont know you in my head because I feel you in my heart</br>
Pumping you through my veins up to my brain you turn my verses into art.</br>
-A.P.</br>
             </p>

<p> You live by the sun,
    </br>
You die by the moon
</br>
but I find otherwise..
</br>
Being tired is not something the sun hopes for you.
</br>
Only the moon wishes you softly to sleep
</br>
Exhaustion you acquire whilst the sun beats its harsh rays down upon you
</br>
Sandmen sprinkle sleep for you while kisses send from the moon.</br>
With the day beating its rays and the night sending a cool breeze, </br>
I rather live by the moon,
than die by the sun.
-A.P.

<p>The first rain of april will soon fall from the sky</br>
    The raindrops will know no difference between kissing the dirt or falling upon the strong leaves of an oak tree,</br>
For the rain nourishes all that it touches without inhibitions.</br>
I wish we could all go around kissing freely and giving love to those that have raindrops fall from their eyes,</br>
and to those that do not know what nourishment they give.</br>
I want to show them what strength they've built out of their weakness,</br>
A fragile seed that's grown into a tree bearing fruit.</br>
The next rain that will fall will not be from your eyes,</br>
but from the skies,</br>
falling upon you and kissing your skin until you see what strong leaves they've given you.</br>
-A.P.</br>
